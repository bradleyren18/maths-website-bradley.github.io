            In the prealgebra session, we solved equations with one variable.
            But what about two?
            In this topic, we are going to explore the world of two variable linear equations.
            There are two main methods:substitution and elimination.
            Click on the buttons below to find out about them.

                document.getElementById("div").innerText = `Here is an example of substitution: 
                    	Consider the equations x + y = 10 and 10x + 8y = 98:
                        First, rearrange the first equation to be x = 10 - y:
                        Then, plug this into the second equation:
                        10(10 - y) + 8y = 98
                        100 - 10y + 8y = 98
                        100 - 2y = 98
                        y = 1
                        x = 9 `

                document.getElementById("div").innerText = `Here is an example of elimination: 
                    	Consider the same equations x + y = 10 and 10x + 8y = 98:
                        First, multiply both sides of the first equation by 10:
                        10x + 10y = 100
                        Then, subtract the second equation from it:
                        (10x + 10y) - (10x + 8y) = 100 - 98
                        2y = 2
                        y = 1
                        x = 9 
                        This is called "eliminating a variable"`
